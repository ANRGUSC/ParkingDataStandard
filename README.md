# ParkingJSON: An Open Standard Format for Parking Data in Smart Cities

This repository contains examples of an open standard format for parking availability data, ParkingJSON, developed at the University of Southern California in partnership with the City of Los Angeles. To learn more abour our parking standard, please refer to the paper, which is available inside the document folder.

## Examples
We provide multiple examples (check example_JSON_files folder) representing different scenarios.


* An example for Downtown Los Angeles area with multiple individual street parking spots is available in a JSON file: DowntownwithSpots.json.
* An example for Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) area with multiple parking lots and sections (or levels) is available in a JSON file: LAXwithLots.json.
* An example for the University of Southern California (USC) campus area with multiple lots and sections (or levels) is available in a JSON file: USCWithLotsandSections.json.
* An example for the University of Southern California (USC) campus area with multiple lots, sections (or levels), and a spot is available in a JSON file: USCWithLotsandSections(partial_data).JSON. This example was created to how the data would like if an area contains lots, sections, and spots.
